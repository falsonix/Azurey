# Q&A
Q: How do I setup a bot account and application?
A: Simply visit https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html for instructions on how to setup a bot account.

Q: Do I need to make a `config.json` file?
A: Yes. It is required for the bot to function.

Q: Help! My bot won't run and throws an error something along the lines of "Insufficient intents"
A: Make sure all 3 intents switches are toggled to ON inside your application. The bot uses these for permission to send messages to users in your server.

Q: I still have no idea how to set this up. Send help please!
A: Go watch a couple `discord.py` tutorials on youtube; This should further your knowledge enough to be able to install the bot on your own. If this doesn't work, ask some of your friends or members of a server you're in.
